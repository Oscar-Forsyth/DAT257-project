What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have not used android studio a lot this week but I aim to be able to work fluently with the team to develop our app. To do this I need to learn more about Android Studio.
 
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
The IT students are helping the others with Github and setting it up but also explaining how to use it. This is a good step in cooperating together and we will continue to try to cooperate to the best of our abilities.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have added and edited user stories, epics and tasks. We are continuously working and adding new things to our scrum board. The way we are working now seems to be effective and I will try to continue with this.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have helped set up Github and start the project. I have also helped with the mockup and planning of the project. I would also like to code a bit more but that will come in the near future.
